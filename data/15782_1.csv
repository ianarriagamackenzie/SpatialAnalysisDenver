I go find the lady working the self check out and her only response is oh, they're all on break I ask when one will be back and she says ten minutes and that I could use the self check out! I don't even want to go into how annoying that was considering there is only so much space to place an item until you have to remove a bag and then everything stops till the lady presses an continue button from her computer. Oh and someone comes up to me and says You have WAY too many items to be here and I said politely Im not here by choice mamn. She leaves. By the time I got home and about 20 other customers passed me by ALL, and I mean ALL of my frozen goods were thawed and drippy. Besides the understaffed issue, their shelves are understocked. Produce and meat are slim pickings all the time. The floors, carts, and everything always feel really dirty.

Each item is carefully chosen (in fact, when the chickens at the local egg farm went on strike, there was an apology note for having to sell what another big chain boutique market considers their \\""top shelf\\"" eggs). Highlights include the cheese cave, butcher counter, and pre-made section (one of these days, though, this Miami native is going to have to show the Marczyks how to make maduros from plantains, rather than bananas). Though the produce section does generally leave something to be desired, the staff can usually make excellent suggestions to work around any ommissions in their stock.

The stocking seems to be haphazard, with no rhyme or reason to it. In addition to the downgrading of their cheese section, they also decimated their olive selection and the produce is really almost nil. Yes, they have nice agreements with certain local and organic farmers, which is great, but the selection is completely erratic and the prices for what they do still have really can't compete with Whole Foods. Also, the daily soup selection used to be much more inventive and what happened to the smaller containers of the once-excellent gazpacho in the summertime? Literally everything has gone downhill, even the bread and pastry selection. I don't understand why. And let's not even talk about the wine shop! The girl in there does not know the first thing about wine. Did the Marczyks really think we wouldn't notice (Hint: Go to Above the Rim instead!)?? The meats are still decent, but when you are a purveyor of imported and specialty items, you really need to invest in a staff that knows their business. Unfortunately, between the dumbing down of your stock and the hiring of less-than-knowledgable staff, I have lost interest in Marczyk's.

BOY WAS I WRONG! When I arrived and saw what was passed off as food I was dumbfounded. I had two cold trays of soggy quotquotquesadillasquotquot and one bowl of chips and guac to feed 30 people (And if I tell you how much they charged me per person you would be dumbfounded too!)

From the beginning I could not lock down specifics from the girl that apparently m inc has employed as their key contact for events/catering.

To say the least I DO NOT recommend using the folks at m inc for ANY of your event planning/catering needs!! Not only was my food cold amp soggy I was rushed out of the area that I quotquotreservedquotquot at Rockbar... this was after purchasing 2 bottles of Mad Dog for what was to be their quotquotbottle servicequotquot the only service I got out of the folks over there was a swift kick in the backside as they shooed my out the door because they told me they were expecting 300-400 people for the evening!

We ordered a few of the appetizers, one of which was chips and guacamole. What we got was a small plate of Tostitos and a bowl of frozen, clumpy avocado. Guacamole is a basic dish any Mexican place should have a handle on, but Mezcal does not have a clue. What is wrong with the kitchen staff that makes it ok to 1) send out food that is frozen, 2) use pre-packaged frozen quotquotguacamolequotquot and 3) think guacamole is nothing more than an avocado cut into a few big pieces and dropped in a bowl. At the table, we joked that it was a surprise they managed to figure out that the pit should be removed. Hoping it was just an oversight, we mentioned the situation to our server. She just laughed, shrugged and affirmed that the plain, frozen avocado chunks we got were really what Mezcal wanted us to have when we ordered guacamole. Her attitude let us know that she knew it was gross, but that the kitchen was just dumb. She laughed along with us in disgust and didn't even try to sell it. The other items we ordered were edible, but totally generic- like the big box of taquitos from the freezer section at the grocery store.

I took a friend who has also lived in Mexico and really knows Mexican food and drink. We ordered a Tamal and a Relleno as appitizers to 'test' the kitchen. It passed with high marks, high enough that my friend, who is a real Relleno snob order more Tamals and Rellenos for his main course. He says the Rellenos are the best in Denver and I know he's eaten a lot of them because it's about all he ever orders. I had fish tacos. While many people think these are a coastal food for Mexico, you get them everywhere and these were excellent breaded Talapia with raw onions and an avacado based salsa. I know why some people have complained about this place it is very typical Northern Mexico. It is what you would get in a better family resturant in Northern Mexico and is therefore strange to folks use to the more typical US style of Mexcian food.

We were disappointed when we got there and learned that 2 of the 4 kosher restaurants we were planning to check out had closed. So we ended up eating at the East Side Kosher Deli for 3 dinners, with friends as our guests, and 2 lunches.Of the 23 entrees we saw, every dish that was served looked delicious and reportedly tasted so as well. The only criticism anyone had was that the ribs were a little dry - our other friend who had the ribs a different night was happy with them. The prices were in line with what we are used to seeing at kosher restaurants.The service was a little erratic, vascillating between very, very good and a little slow. I did have to walk over to the waitress one night to place our wine order, but mostly the service was acceptable.The menu is varied and interesting. We ate a lot of fish - creative dishes that were perfectly prepared. The fajitas are amazing the soups were particularly good.We bought tuna sandwiches from the grocery deli for a picnic lunch. They were as delicious as a tuna sandwich can be. For Shabbat and Sunday lunch we bought schnitzel and a variety of salads. Everything was quite good.It's a shame Denver's community can support only this one restaurant. They're very lucky, however, that their only kosher option is of such high quality.

And if you don't like people, consider getting a desk job instead."",""sourceURLs"":[""https://www.yellowpages.com/denver-co/mip/st-marks-coffee-house-15247224""],""dateSeen"":""2019-10-26T15:43:00.000Z""}]",,,"https://www.trip.com/denver/restaurants/st-marks-coffeehouse,https://foursquare.com/v/st-marks-coffee-house/41044980f964a5206d0b1fe3/menu,http://www.citysearch.com/profile/1831777/denver_co/st_mark_s_coffee_house.html,https://foursquare.com/v/st-marks-coffee-house/41044980f964a5206d0b1fe3,https://www.yellowbook.com/profile/st-marks-coffee-house_1530344527.html,https://www.yellowpages.com/denver-co/mip/st-marks-coffee-house-15247224",,,,"http://www.stmarkscoffeehouse.com/",,1990

Well, i guess you can't expect much from a coffee shop whose owners own Taco Bell."",""doRecommend"":""false"",""sourceURLs"":[""http://www.citysearch.com/profile/1842924/denver_co/dazbog_coffee.html""]},{""username"":""Alex Tooke"",""date"":""2011-10-21T00:00:00Z"",""dateSeen"":""2019-03-23T00:00:00Z"",""text"":""over rated"",""sourceURLs"":[""https://foursquare.com/v/dazbog-coffee/4b11cb6bf964a520c78423e3""]},{""username"":""Scott Bullock"",""date"":""2012-11-20T00:00:00Z"",""dateSeen"":""2019-03-23T00:00:00Z"",""text"":""the staff is always friendly i love the chai here"",""sourceURLs"":[""https://foursquare.com/v/dazbog-coffee/4b11cb6bf964a520c78423e3""]},{""username"":""Paul Juarez"",""date"":""2014-03-22T00:00:00Z"",""dateSeen"":""2019-03-23T00:00:00Z"",""text"":""great quality of service and good prices"",""sourceURLs"":[""https://foursquare.com/v/dazbog-coffee/4b11cb6bf964a520c78423e3""]},{""username"":""Derek Weber"",""date"":""2013-04-08T00:00:00Z"",""dateSeen"":""2019-03-23T00:00:00Z"",""text"":""tastes like charcoal and they are just big business that force good small businesses out of business httpkdvrcom20130403cheesmanparkeaterysaysitlosesleasebecauseofnearbycoffeeshop"",""sourceURLs"":[""https://foursquare.com/v/dazbog-coffee/4b11cb6bf964a520c78423e3""]},{""username"":""Mike Luetjen"",""date"":""2011-02-16T00:00:00Z"",""dateSeen"":""2019-03-23T00:00:00Z"",""text"":""i come here mostly because of derek hes awesome damn good customer service oh yeah the coffee and bagels are good too"",""sourceURLs"":[""https://foursquare.com/v/dazbog-coffee/4b11cb6bf964a520c78423e3""]},{""username"":""Don Heldenbrand"",""date"":""2013-06-30T00:00:00Z"",""dateSeen"":""2019-03-23T00:00:00Z"",""text"":""dazbog is working very hard to drive customers away"",""sourceURLs"":[""https://foursquare.com/v/dazbog-coffee/4b11cb6bf964a520c78423e3""]},{""username"":""Wayne Sutton"",""date"":""2012-03-03T00:00:00Z"",""dateSeen"":""2019-03-23T00:00:00Z"",""text"":""this place is super gay"",""sourceURLs"":[""https://foursquare.com/v/dazbog-coffee/4b11cb6bf964a520c78423e3""]}]",,,"https://foursquare.com/v/dazbog-coffee/4b11cb6bf964a520c78423e3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33388-d5451647-Reviews-Dazbog_Coffee-Denver_Colorado.html,http://www.citysearch.com/profile/1842924/denver_co/dazbog_coffee.html",,,,"http://www.dazbog.com/",,

I took a friend who has also lived in Mexico and really knows Mexican food and drink. We ordered a Tamal and a Relleno as appitizers to 'test' the kitchen. It passed with high marks, high enough that my friend, who is a real Relleno snob order more Tamals and Rellenos for his main course. He says the Rellenos are the best in Denver and I know he's eaten a lot of them because it's about all he ever orders. I had fish tacos. While many people think these are a coastal food for Mexico, you get them everywhere and these were excellent breaded Talapia with raw onions and an avacado based salsa. I know why some people have complained about this place it is very typical Northern Mexico. It is what you would get in a better family resturant in Northern Mexico and is therefore strange to folks use to the more typical US style of Mexcian food.

We ordered a few of the appetizers, one of which was chips and guacamole. What we got was a small plate of Tostitos and a bowl of frozen, clumpy avocado. Guacamole is a basic dish any Mexican place should have a handle on, but Mezcal does not have a clue. What is wrong with the kitchen staff that makes it ok to 1) send out food that is frozen, 2) use pre-packaged frozen quotquotguacamolequotquot and 3) think guacamole is nothing more than an avocado cut into a few big pieces and dropped in a bowl. At the table, we joked that it was a surprise they managed to figure out that the pit should be removed. Hoping it was just an oversight, we mentioned the situation to our server. She just laughed, shrugged and affirmed that the plain, frozen avocado chunks we got were really what Mezcal wanted us to have when we ordered guacamole. Her attitude let us know that she knew it was gross, but that the kitchen was just dumb. She laughed along with us in disgust and didn't even try to sell it. The other items we ordered were edible, but totally generic- like the big box of taquitos from the freezer section at the grocery store. Mezcal should spend less time trying to look edgy for the yuppies and research some quality TV dinners they can substitute for their crp food."",""rating"":1.0,""sourceURLs"":[""https://www.yellowpages.com/denver-co/mip/mezcal-1866738""]},{""dateSeen"":""2019-01-31T00:00:00Z"",""date"":""2007-04-10T00:00:00.000Z"",""username"":""denverkarin"",""text"":""I have never encountered a more grouchy, cantakerous group of people in my life!

You will be overcharged for old, stale, mediocre crap. And you may get the bonus of being ridiculed in front of everyone for the owner's amusement. It has the look and feel of a place that someone really cared about a looooong time ago. Now it looks and feels like no one really cares, like the owner is just going through the motions with the same old, same old. It is very expensive and the quality is a mixed bag. I've bought pounds of desserts and cookies and they were TERRIBLE. 15.99/lb and Every cookie was stale and tasted like the inside of the old, stale fridge case they are kept in (they try wrapping them in plastic wrap, but they all still taste the same - stale. I've ordered sandwiches quite a few times and have gotten really stale hard bread on a couple of them. REally sucks on a 15 sandwich I've tried prepared items out of their deli case and they seemed to taste like the dirty old fridge they are kept in. I just don't have the courage to order anything like the meat, steaks or cold cuts to try. REcently, I went in to order a couple of sandwiches and the owner (first time he ever served me) kept up an uncomfortable running dialogue about not serving people who want mayonaise on a sandwich. He spent 20 minutes ridiculing my taste, my choices, telling stories about kicking someone out, like me, who wanted mayo on a sandwich. He had a great time snickering to his other employees, making jokes for the other 5 customers to laugh at ... all at my expense. Over and over, talking about mayo while i tried to laugh it off and joke too. But he kept going even after all the other customers were not laughing and were looking at me uncomfortably. He just wouldn't stop. I guess he doesn't get the opportunity to bully people elswhere and does it to his own customers!! This guy thinks he's the soup nazi of subs, ferchrissakes. And he is NOT funny. And the food is NOT that good. Definitely NOT worth the money. I considered walking out while he was making the freakin things, but decided I'd see how far he'd take it, then share his inappropriate, unprofessional, dickhead behavior with everyone! And he took it all the way. So, you decide if you want to get ripped off with old stale product and made fun of to boot. I'd rather go to Tommy's Subs, cheaper, better and friendlier, but not open on Mondays. -)"",""sourceURLs"":[""http://www.citysearch.com/profile/1857478/lakewood_co/carmine_lonardo_s_italian.html""]}]",,,"http://www.citysearch.com/profile/1857478/lakewood_co/carmine_lonardo_s_italian.html,https://www.trip.com/lakewood-co/restaurants/carmine-lonardos-italian",,,,,,

There were individual cheesecakes and flans and mousses and cakes, but also big cakes for multiple people.

The folks at Marczyk's, from the owner to the butcher, are friendly and knowledgable. Though the selection may seem limited, this is not a supermarket. Each item is carefully chosen (in fact, when the chickens at the local egg farm went on strike, there was an apology note for having to sell what another big chain boutique market considers their quotquottop shelfquotquot eggs). Highlights include the cheese cave, butcher counter, and pre-made section (one of these days, though, this Miami native is going to have to show the Marczyks how to make maduros from plantains, rather than bananas). Though the produce section does generally leave something to be desired, the staff can usually make excellent suggestions to work around any ommissions in their stock. In all, Marzyk's is an incredible, around-the-corner neighborhood market. My frequent shopper rewards there are embarassingly large, so to say I recommend the place is an understatement."",""rating"":5.0,""sourceURLs"":[""https://www.yellowpages.com/denver-co/mip/marczyk-fine-foods-4504595""]}]",,,"https://www.yellowpages.com/denver-co/mip/marczyk-fine-foods-4504595",,,,"http://www.marczykfinefoods.com/",,

I do wish that they would emulate the KC location and offer at least one vegetarian menu item per day."",""sourceURLs"":[""http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3711754305/andres-restaurant-denver""]},{""date"":""2009-01-03T00:00:00.000Z"",""username"":""Angela P."",""rating"":4.0,""dateSeen"":""2019-02-23T00:00:00Z"",""title"":""Great choice for a girl's lunch."",""text"":""My book club stopped here for lunch before an event.

I had assumed until then that they were like a GNC. This was before they made Natural Grocers a prominent part of their name. At the time (this was several years ago) I had not yet embraced organic and whole foods. I remember thinking it was too small and quaint for my tastes. I did like their natural beauty section though! I've really changed since then. Now I will wait until they open to go without or go for coffee cream rather than King Sooper which is a little easier to get to. I have come to absolutely embrace the smaller store with the quiet lights - instead of wasting hours and money and ending up with a headache - I go, I know what I want, I don't buy more than I need, the experience is friendly, and yes, I have confidence that what I buy is the best available. Thank you VC for doing the work for me so I can get back to living. And we've found that we actually spend less every week which is counterintuitive being that most things are organic. I really think it is because we are buying more whole foods and cooking more. I also take advantage of their markdowns in fruit and dairy. Also their natural paper products and pet foods are less expensive. It's funny - we had eagerly anticipated the Sunflower Farmers Market to open in our area - but now that it is we only went a few times. Much too crowded and again, the feeling there is a lot of bait and switch - we always spend too much money on things we didn't really need or go in for. VC is an awesome little store (and so are others we've been to in the area).

It is my impression that one is supposed to give an honest, not a pretty or fun to read, review of their experience. I didn't go out of my way to write my review any more than anyone else does to write theirs. I have heard he makes really good sandwiches. If anything, I went out of my way to balance my feelings with something positive. I also mentioned that there were other occasions in the past where he'd been friendly. (That's I guess, was why I was surprised). I wasn't trying to disparage his work, only tell how I felt when I went in (I owned it). I was mostly trying to make the point that if people are in business in a neighborhood and are intentionally or unintentionally offputting towards a neighbor who might well know many other neighbors, it might not be the best for business. That it is good to use care toward what most of the people in there are, quotquotneighbors.quotquot You can see another review of mine where a shop owners individualistic attitude or tone might add character to a place in cases. This was just not one of them (for me at least). I did not have enough time to be any certain way in my comment about giving people the benefit of the doubt. I was speaking in general, and do (sincerely) believe that everyone should be allowed a bad day or a day they do not feel their best or whatever now and then.

He then asks if there is any1 having a birthday sliring his words, the lady next to my mother says me, 3 mins later he asks the little girl if its her birthday forgeting that he already asked that the lady says no its my birthday, after that was figured out he then asks were every1 is from sliring his words once again, everyone says Denver. 2 mins later he asks the same question then thinks we are from NY, mean while the food is being burnt and he is twirling around knifes ( the three litttle kids looked tarrified).

I called the Denver Location at 1:00 pm asking if there would be a possibilty of making a reservation for my wifes 27th birthday party of four. (wife, son, son, me) I was told they had availibilty for my reservation at 8:30. We show up at Benihana at 8:30 check in and they make us wait. Time is going by and we start to see multiple party's being seated that didn't have reservatiuons nor been waiting as long as we were. I happened to get up and ask the host what was the wait and she looked as if she was confused or not willing to help. We sat and waited. After 20 minutes went bye we still were waiting wondering if we were going to be seated for our reservation at 8:30 which it was now 8:50. Waiting Waiting Waiting!!!!!!!! Watching more party's sit at tables that didnt have reservations. I asked when we arrived if there was any reservations in front of our party, the host said NO. Now at 9:10pm I seen the Manager at the host table so I walked over and asked why we haven't been seated with our 8:30 reservation. He told me he was sorry and noting he could do about it. I'm very frustrated at this time and have to tell my two boys and wife lets go. It was a horrible and rude experience. I'm starting to think race had a big part in the whole issue.

I visited last Thursday with my best friend to celebrate her birthday. We're both members of the quotquotChef's Tablequotquot and on prior visits always ordered the quotquotmeal for twoquotquot in conjunction with the Chef's table discount. This time was no different, we ordered the meal for two, presented the server with her birthday coupon, and then had dinner. Despite horribly slow service and a table grill that wouldn't heat properly, we eventually finished our meal. Immediately after dessert was served, we were approached by the server, who informed us that policy has recently changed, and that despite ordering the meal for two we would have to pay for two separate meals in order for my friend to use her birthday discount. The on duty manager lady didn't care about our situation, and simply brushed us off, telling us that we were out of luck and have to pay for the two separate meals and eat the price difference. Had we been informed on ordering that the discount was not available on the menu item we chose, I wouldn't have had any problem, however not telling us, letting us eat the meal, then demanding more money for the meal after the fact was absolutely unprofessional.

You can get authentic Cantonese food (whole steamed fish, Am Choy, salt and pepper shrimp) at a very reasonable price, and brush up on your cantonese language skills.
